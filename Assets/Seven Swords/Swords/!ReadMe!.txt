Thanks for downloading Seven Swords v2!

Here are just a couple of quick notes about the pack:
	• Seven Swords v2 features a complete rework of the materials. All swords now feature high quality PBR textures at 2K resolution.
	• All materials are set up to HDRP by default. For URP, try Unity's built in material conversion tool.
	• The original version is included in its own UnityPackage. Please note that this version is only included for legacy purposes and is not being updated.
